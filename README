AADL v3 improvements branch
===========================

This branch started to support improvements for the AASPE project but
it is also used to prototype new AADL v3 features. You will
see a list of changes/new features brought into this branch.

= Hardware Flows
Hardware flows are the possibility to be able to specify
flows only with hardware components. For example, a flow
starts from a processor that pass through a bus and
end up in a device.


= Buses access on virtual processors
In partitioned architectures, virtual processors (that capture
partitions) can have access to the hardware to send/receive
data on a bus. For that purpose, we need to capture the access
to the physical hardware using a bus access on the partition
runtime, which is captures by a virtual processor component.

= Virtual memory
Introduction of the virtual memory component. Very basic
for now, enough to support our modeling patterns for the 
AASPE case study.
